Hello! I am Dipankar, a researcher at the [UNSW-NLP](https://unswnlp.github.io/) group at [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/). My research interests broadly lie in socio-culturally inclusive language technologies. 

I graduated with a Master of Information Technology with Excellence from UNSW Sydney. My masters thesis, supervised by Dr. Aditya Joshi, involved evaluating and improving dialect robustness for decoder models using adapter-based methods.
